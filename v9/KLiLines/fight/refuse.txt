1: punch KXiao 
You throw a punch at KXiao but narrowly miss as he backflips into the air and does a quintuple somersault
KXiao: I didn't expect you to be here. Well now my plans are foiled.
KXiao: GIIIIIIGGGGAAAAAAA CHAAAAAAAAD OUTTTTTTT
He vanishes in a flash of light

Kevin: Well, I guess he's gone
Kevin: I didn't expect you to be able to fight back in this state. But your work isn't finished, you need to chase after him. 
Kevin: To do that, you need to go back to the beginning and not be tricked by his stories
